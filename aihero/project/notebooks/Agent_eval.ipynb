      "## Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`add_documents`**:\n",
      "  - Used to add a list of text documents to the vector store. \n",
      "  - This method works with `Document` objects that have `page_content` and `metadata` attributes.\n",
      "  - Example:\n",

      "    ```python\n",
      "    vector_store.delete(ids=[\"doc1\"])\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`similarity_search`**:\n",
      "  - Searches for documents that are similar to a given query.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Notes\n",
      "- When adding documents, it is recommended to provide IDs to avoid duplication and facilitate updates.\n",

      "### AlphaCodium Approach\n",
      "- **Definition**: AlphaCodium is a test-based, multi-stage, iterative flow aimed at enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in code generation tasks.\n",
      "- **Key Features**:\n",
      "  - Focuses on matching the precise syntax of target programming languages.\n",
      "  - Designed to identify both common and edge cases in coding problems.\n",
      "  - Addresses intricate details found in problem specifications that are critical in coding tasks.\n",
      "  - Implements an iterative flow which has demonstrably improved task performance, as evidenced by a notable increase in accuracy from 19% to 44% for GPT-4 in specific code generation challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Differences from Traditional Methods\n",
      "- **Traditional Methods**:\n",
      "  - Often rely on single prompt designs without iterative refinement.\n",
      "  - May not adequately address the nuances of coding languages or handle edge cases effectively.\n",
      "  - Typically follow a simple input-output mechanism without the multi-stage validation present in AlphaCodium.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Comparison**:\n",
      "  - AlphaCodium's approach is more structured and focuses on iterative improvements, which is a significant shift from the conventional single-pass generation strategies.\n",

      "To contribute code to the LangChain codebase, follow these steps as outlined in the repository documentation:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Contributing Steps\n",
      "1. **Review Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the contributing guidelines.\n",
      "2. **Common Checklist**:\n",
      "   - Verify that there are no breaking changes to the public API.\n",
      "   - Ensure all functions have complete type annotations.\n",
      "   - Fully test new functionalities.\n",
      "   - Check for security issues (avoid dangerous patterns).\n",
      "   - Write Google-style docstrings for public functions.\n",
      "   - Ensure code quality by passing `make lint` and `make format`.\n",
      "   - Suggest architectural improvements where applicable.\n",
      "   - Follow the Conventional Commits format for your commit messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Guidelines and Best Practices\n",
      "- **Documentation**: Updates and new docs are welcome, but be cautious about merging new tutorials unless necessary.\n",
      "- **Linking**: Frequently link to other sections within the documentation to enhance understanding.\n",
      "- **Conciseness**: Be concise in your explanations and examples, and avoid duplication of content.\n",
      "- **General Style**: Use active voice, appropriate header levels, bullet points, and tables to organize content effectively.\n",

      "❓ How can I use the .bind_tools() method to connect multiple tools to my LangChain model?\n",
      "✅ Response Result:\n",
      "To connect multiple tools to your LangChain model using the `.bind_tools()` method, you can follow the process outlined below:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Steps to Use `.bind_tools()`\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tool Creation:**\n",
      "   - Create the tools you want to use. You can use decorators like `@tool` to define your tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tool Binding:**\n",
      "   - Use the `.bind_tools()` method to specify which tools are available for the model to call. This should be done by passing a list of the tools you've created.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools_list)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using the Model:**\n",
      "   - After binding the tools, you can invoke the model as usual. If a tool call is made, the model's response will include the tool call arguments which can be passed directly to the tool.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   response = model_with_tools.invoke(user_input)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Code\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example where a simple multiplication function is bound to the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
      "    \"\"\"Multiply a and b.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Args:\n",
      "        a: first int\n",
      "        b: second int\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    return a * b\n",
      "\n",
      "llm_with_tools = tool_calling_model.bind_tools([multiply])\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that the model you are using supports tool calling.\n",
      "- Choose appropriate names and descriptions for your tools to enhance usability.\n",
      "- Keep the tools simple and narrowly scoped for better model performance.\n",

The key methods available are:\n\n## Methods\n\n- **`add_documents`**:\n  - Used to add a list of text documents to the vector store. \n  - This method works with `Document` objects that have `page_content` and `metadata` attributes.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents)\n    ```\n\n- **`delete`**:\n  - Deletes a list of documents from the vector store using their IDs.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    vector_store.delete(ids=[\"doc1\"])\n    ```\n\n- **`similarity_search`**:\n  - Searches for documents that are similar to a given query.\n\n## Additional Notes\n- When adding documents, it is recommended to provide IDs to avoid duplication and facilitate updates.\n\nThese methods allow users to effectively manipulate documents in the vector store by adding, deleting, and searching for similar documents.\n\n## Sources\n- **langchain-master/docs/docs/concepts/vectorstores.mdx**\n- **langchain-master/docs/docs/integrations/providers/zep.mdx**",

         "To connect multiple tools to your LangChain model using the `.bind_tools()` method, you can follow the process outlined below:\n\n### Steps to Use `.bind_tools()`\n\n1. **Tool Creation:**\n   - Create the tools you want to use. You can use decorators like `@tool` to define your tools.\n\n2. **Tool Binding:**\n   - Use the `.bind_tools()` method to specify which tools are available for the model to call. This should be done by passing a list of the tools you've created.\n   ```python\n   model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools_list)\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the Model:**\n   - After binding the tools, you can invoke the model as usual. If a tool call is made, the model's response will include the tool call arguments which can be passed directly to the tool.\n   ```python\n   response = model_with_tools.invoke(user_input)\n   ```\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere is an example where a simple multiplication function is bound to the model:\n\n```python\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Multiply a and b.\n    \n    Args:\n        a: first int\n        b: second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\nllm_with_tools = tool_calling_model.bind_tools([multiply])\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Ensure that the model you are using supports tool calling.\n- Choose appropriate names and descriptions for your tools to enhance usability.\n- Keep the tools simple and narrowly scoped for better model performance.\n\n### Sources\n- langchain-master/docs/docs/concepts/tool_calling.mdx (sections on Recommended usage, Tool binding, and Key concepts)",

The key methods available are:\n\n## Methods\n\n- **`add_documents`**:\n  - Used to add a list of text documents to the vector store. \n  - This method works with `Document` objects that have `page_content` and `metadata` attributes.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents)\n    ```\n\n- **`delete`**:\n  - Deletes a list of documents from the vector store using their IDs.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    vector_store.delete(ids=[\"doc1\"])\n    ```\n\n- **`similarity_search`**:\n  - Searches for documents that are similar to a given query.\n\n## Additional Notes\n- When adding documents, it is recommended to provide IDs to avoid duplication and facilitate updates.\n\nThese methods allow users to effectively manipulate documents in the vector store by adding, deleting, and searching for similar documents.\n\n## Sources\n- **langchain-master/docs/docs/concepts/vectorstores.mdx**\n- **langchain-master/docs/docs/integrations/providers/zep.mdx**",

         "## AlphaCodium Approach vs. Traditional Methods of Code Generation\n\n### AlphaCodium Approach\n- **Definition**: AlphaCodium is a test-based, multi-stage, iterative flow aimed at enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in code generation tasks.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Focuses on matching the precise syntax of target programming languages.\n  - Designed to identify both common and edge cases in coding problems.\n  - Addresses intricate details found in problem specifications that are critical in coding tasks.\n  - Implements an iterative flow which has demonstrably improved task performance, as evidenced by a notable increase in accuracy from 19% to 44% for GPT-4 in specific code generation challenges.\n\n### Differences from Traditional Methods\n- **Traditional Methods**:\n  - Often rely on single prompt designs without iterative refinement.\n  - May not adequately address the nuances of coding languages or handle edge cases effectively.\n  - Typically follow a simple input-output mechanism without the multi-stage validation present in AlphaCodium.\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - AlphaCodium's approach is more structured and focuses on iterative improvements, which is a significant shift from the conventional single-pass generation strategies.\n\n### Conclusion\nAlphaCodium represents a paradigm shift in code generation by employing a comprehensive and iterative method that reacts to the challenges specific to coding tasks, showcasing a stark contrast to traditional methods that depend on simpler prompting techniques.\n\n### Sources\n- langchain-master/docs/docs/additional_resources/arxiv_references.mdx",

         "## Integrating Cassandra as a Vector Store in Langchain\n\nTo integrate Cassandra as a vector store in your Langchain project, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import the Cassandra Vector Store:**\n   You need to import the necessary module from the Langchain community.\n\n   ```python\n   from langchain_community.vectorstores import Cassandra\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up the Cassandra Cache (optional):**\n   If you would like to use Cassandra as a semantic cache, you can set it up as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache\n   from langchain_community.cache import CassandraSemanticCache\n\n   set_llm_cache(CassandraSemanticCache(\n       embedding=my_embedding,\n       table_name=\"my_store\",\n   ))\n   ```\n\n   This step is optional and depends on your specific requirements for caching.\n\n3. **Explore Further:**\n   For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the example notebook linked in the documentation.\n\n### Additional Tools\nIf you are using Cassandra in conjunction with other functionalities, consider using the following tools:\n\n- **Get Schema:**\n  ```python\n  from langchain_community.tools import GetSchemaCassandraDatabaseTool\n  ```\n\n- **Get Table Data:**\n  ```python\n  from langchain_community.tools import GetTableDataCassandraDatabaseTool\n  ```\n\n- **Query:**\n  ```python\n  from langchain_community.tools import QueryCassandraDatabaseTool\n  ```\n\n### Useful Links\n- [Example Notebook for Integration](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/cassandra)\n- [Apache Cassandra Integration Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/cassandra/)\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to successfully integrate Cassandra as a vector store in your Langchain project.\n\n### Sources\n- `langchain-master/docs/docs/integrations/providers/cassandra.mdx` (Vector Store, Semantic LLM Cache, LLM Cache)\n- `langchain-master/docs/docs/integrations/providers/apache.mdx` (Apache Cassandra Overview)",
